# Engine-RUL-Prediction-A-Predictive-Maintenance-Approach
A Python project for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines using sensor data. This repository implements several machine learning techniques—including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM networks—to analyze multivariate time series data and support predictive maintenance.
